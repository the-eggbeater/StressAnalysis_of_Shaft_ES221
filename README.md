# StressAnalysis_of_Shaft_ES221
The repository contains the report for the ES 221 Mechanics of Solids course project. 
The report provides simulation results for the Twisting and Bending of Shafts under Pure Torsion, Pure Bending and their superposition. The simulation have been done under the assumptions and approximations of the Euler Beam Bending Theory and Engineering Analysis of beams
